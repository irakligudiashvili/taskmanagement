Task Management System - Final Exam PHP

This project was part of the final examination for my PHP course.

Given that the sole focus of the project was making use of the PHP knowledge acquired during the course & being given a limited time frame to build the site, little attention has been given to the front-end side of things. As such, there is no JavaScript/JQuery used, and just some basic CSS has been used.

Screen resolution built for: 1920x1080

The goal of the project was to create a task management system for a company that would allow for the following:

Adding & removing users

Configuring user information

Assigning tasks & deadlines

Completing tasks, with the final result of a completed task being an uploaded link

Viewing completed tasks

Limited views & permissions depending on the rank & department of the user (Employee, Manager & Admin)

  Employee would be limited to information about them
  Managers would be limited to themselves & their department
  Admins have no restrictions
 
 
To sign in and view the pages, any of the accounts in 'users' may be used from the database.

The password for most of the accounts is 123.
